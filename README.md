# Fetching
Fetching is a Tinder-style app for dogs to find their very own Best Fur Friends. This vanilla NativeScript app searches for compatible dogs using the [Petfinder API](https://www.petfinder.com/developers/api-docs). 

## Getting Started

This app is built with the NativeScript CLI. Once you have the [CLI installed](https://docs.nativescript.org/start/quick-setup), start by cloning the repo:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/jlooper/fetching-app-vanilla.git
$ cd fetching-app-vanilla
```

Register for a Petfinder API key [here](https://www.petfinder.com/developers/api-key).

Add your API key in the `config.js` file.

To run Fetching on iOS:

```
$ tns run ios
```

To run Fetching on Android:

```
$ tns run android
```
